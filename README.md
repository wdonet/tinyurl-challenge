# TinyURL Challenge
In Wize Services we hate to paste long links in our social networks. We are so hipster that we hate all 3rd party services that do this job, because... gosh, so mainstream.

Your goal for this challenge is to create a URL Shortner Service. We are providing you with:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) scaffolded application
- [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com) API Access

Your application **must** cover the next features:

- Endpoint that recieves a long link and generates a short one.
- Short URL must redirect to the original long link.

If you want **bonus points** you can cover one or all of the next features:

- Frontend UI
- URL Listing
- Destroy ability
- Edit original URL ability
- Personalized short URL

Please document any assumption that you need to take, for example: length of tiny URL, test cases, etc.
